# The facil.io Object (FIOBJ) extension

This is a standalone facil.io extension for soft dynamic types.

The FIOBJ library can be used without the facil.io core library. To allow for this use-case, some code duplication occurs.

To access the FIOBJ API, simply include `fiobj.h` from your project.

When using the FIOBJ library without facil.io, copy all the files in this folder and the facil.io core header file (`fio.h`) to your project. Than include `fiobj.h` to access the API.
